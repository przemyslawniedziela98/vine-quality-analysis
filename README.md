# vine-quality-analysis

## Description
Detailed analysis and model training on a wine quality dataset have been conducted. An EDA was performed to understand the distribution and relationships of the features. The data was preprocessed by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical ones. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets. Three models, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor, were trained and evaluated. The performance of these models was assessed using standard perfomance metrics. Predictions on new data points were also demonstrated. Among the models, RandomForestRegressor showed the best performance due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features more effectively than LinearRegression or DecisionTreeRegressor.
